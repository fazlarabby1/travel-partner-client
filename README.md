*********************************
The project is based on Travel Management System. Here, I have shown services that can be executed by a single person. On other hand, you can call this a personal website.

*********************************
In the home page, there is a navbar at the top. Under that, I have used carousel. Then, I have shown a glimpse of my services by showing just 3 services. And at the bottom of the home page there is a footer.

*********************************
In the services page, I have show all the services in the left side, and there is a review section on the right side that shows all the reviews of different persons. There is a link to provide review as well. However, to provide review, one must login first.

*********************************
The login user will see more options in the NavBar than other users. There is a My Reviews option which will take the user to a page where the person will see all his reviews on different services.
Then there is another option called Add Service, which contains a form. A logged in user can add different services from that page.
There is a Blogs page, which contains some blogs.

*********************************
I have implemented JWT access token in this project as well.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
